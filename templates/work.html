                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">Last month I decided I was going to free all the monkeys in the zoo. Mr. Avery made us watch this video in biology class about monkeys and a guy named Darwin and how we are basically monkeys if you really think about it. &ldquo;Monkeys should be able to vote!&rdquo; he said while turning the lights back on after the video finished. All my classmates laughed, but I didn&rsquo;t find it funny.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">I&rsquo;m in third grade now so my mom thinks it is ok for me to walk back home after school. I think she&rsquo;s just too lazy to pick me up. But at least now I have time to think about monkeys, and why we keep monkeys in cages if they are just like people. Last night, I asked my dad if he thought monkeys should be able to vote. He giggled and then told me to go to bed. What is so funny?</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">On Monday, I stayed awake until my dad came home to ask him if he would take me to the zoo. He smelled like sweat and looked tired.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Hey dad,&rdquo; I said quietly. &ldquo;I stayed up for you!&rdquo;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Go to bed, Alex,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Can you take me to the zoo this weekend? I want to see the monkeys,&rdquo; I asked.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;What? Sure, yeah. Now go to bed.&rdquo;</span></p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">On Friday, I didn&rsquo;t pay attention in school. I was only thinking about the zoo. I didn&rsquo;t know if this was going to be my only chance, so I had to plan everything. On my way home, I bought 5 bananas, 5 apples (in case they don&rsquo;t like bananas), and a pack of sticky notes. My backpack was heavy with notebooks and food. All I wanted to do was to go home and take it off. My mom was waiting for me with something that smelled delicious. Pizza maybe?</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Hey, honey. How was school today?&rdquo; she said, as she put on the puffy oven gloves.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Good, I think. Are you excited about tomorrow?!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the pizza or the zoo.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening tomorrow?&rdquo; she asked. She grabbed a big pot covered with aluminum foil and placed it on the kitchen table.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the zoo. Didn&rsquo;t dad tell you?&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t smell like pizza anymore. &ldquo;What is it? Pizza?&rdquo;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;No, baby. It&rsquo;s creamy fish pie, just like the doctor recommended.&rdquo; She carefully uncovered the pot, and the smell of cooked fish took over the house. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go to the zoo tomorrow, honey. We are seeing Dr. Roberts, remember?&rdquo;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;But dad promised to take me to the zoo,&rdquo; I said.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to your father when he gets home. We can go to the zoo some other time.&rdquo; She took a huge chunk of the fish pie and put it on my dish. It looked like mac and cheese, but it definitely didn&rsquo;t taste like it. &ldquo;Now finish your food, and don&rsquo;t forget to take your pills.&rdquo;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">I did what she said then went to my room and hid under my sheets waiting for dad to come. &nbsp;The pills make me tired, so I couldn&rsquo;t wait very long this time.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">It was Saturday morning, and my mom made pancakes. I got my backpack ready, and put the bananas and apples in, a pair of binoculars, a notebook, my sticky notes, and my big batman pencil. As I walked towards the kitchen, I saw my mom and dad talking quietly to each other. My mom looked angry.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Hey, honey. How did you sleep? I made you some pancakes. Come sit with us.&rdquo; She looked like she was going to say something bad. And she did. &ldquo;Alex, I talked to your dad. He didn&rsquo;t say he was going to take you to the zoo.&rdquo; My dad was just eating the pancakes, not looking up.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie, mom!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Dad said he would take me. I waited for him to come home. Remember, Dad?&rdquo; I wanted to cry.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;You must have forgotten your pills, baby. You wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to stay awake if you had taken them.&rdquo; She was being condescending. I just learnt that word. Why was Dad not telling Mom the truth? &ldquo;Now finish your pancakes, we&rsquo;re going to see Dr. Roberts.&rdquo;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">Dr. Roberts is a tall, skinny, and ugly man that gives me goosebumps every time he touches my shoulder. I hated going to see him, hated it even more this time. My mom always gives me her purse and makes me wait outside his office when they talk. Shouldn&rsquo;t I listen too? I&rsquo;m almost 9 and I can handle myself. I even walk back from school by myself now. My dad promised he was going to take me to the zoo today. I was tired of doing what everyone told me to do. I looked inside my mom&rsquo;s purse, took her tiny wallet out, and left her purse on the brown chair outside Dr. Roberts&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">Before I could make a plan, I was inside a cab. The driver looked dirty and sad. For a second, I thought I should just get out and go back. But I didn&rsquo;t.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Oh, hey there, little fella. Where are your parents?&rdquo; he said. I could see him looking at me through the rear-view mirror.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;They are at the zoo; I&rsquo;m meeting them there. But I&rsquo;m already late. Look. I have money!&rdquo; I showed him the inside of my mom&rsquo;s wallet. It was full.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Sure, what the hell.&rdquo; He took off.</span></p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">We arrived at the zoo in less than 20 minutes. He parked right in front of a huge gate that read &ldquo;Santa Barbara Zoo.&rdquo; It had a picture of a giraffe and a tree and a big sun in the background.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">&ldquo;Here we are, son. Now where are your parents?&rdquo; he asked. But I was already out of the car. I left him a bunch of bills; he was very nice, so I think he deserved them. Maybe he can buy something to smell nicer.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">The zoo was full. Everyone looked like they knew where they were going. I started following a family with a stroller with a blue balloon hanging from the back. The crowd of people started getting more and more packed as we approached the entrance. People were behind me, in front of me, and on my sides. I felt like I was caged. That made me think about the monkeys again, and my backpack. I really wished I had my backpack. A girl with a yellow shirt was looking at a paper that the man with the stroller gave her. They were taking too long so I just walked right through and no one seemed to care.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">There I was. Inside the zoo, with no backpack, no food, and no parents. I saw a map on the floor that people had been stepping on, so I picked it up. I&rsquo;ve never been good at reading, so it took me a while to figure out where the monkeys were. After plenty of walking I reached a jungle-like section. It felt wet and warm. There were monkey and bird noises playing from big speakers near the entrance. Next to the speakers, there was a picture of a monkey eating a banana with a big red cross across it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feed the monkeys,&rdquo; it said. The poor monkeys don&rsquo;t even get food, I thought. I really wanted my backpack.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Helvetica",serif;text-align:justify;'>
                        <span style="font-size: 15px;">I started running, faster and faster, until I saw them. Most of them were just sleeping. They were big and black, skinny and brown, some of them were even red. I got really close to the cold glass and just looked at them for what felt like hours. There was a small monkey that was not sleeping or jumping around like the others; it was staring at me. It was a small orange monkey with hairy ears and big black eyes. It started walking slowly towards me until it reached the glass. I put my hands on the glass and the monkey did the same. Our hands were the same size, but his eyes looked as big as the moon. We continued looking at each other for some time and after a while we both started crying. My mom pulled me off the glass. She was crying also. She started yelling about Dr. Roberts and how I&rsquo;m very sick and shouldn&rsquo;t be alone, and how dumb and stupid I was. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m stupid. Next week I will come back to give the monkey some food. And I won&rsquo;t forget my backpack.</span>
